# Evaluating Explainable Methods for Predictive Process Analytics: A Functionally-Grounded Approach 
The code used in this repository is adapted from <a href="https://github.com/irhete/predictive-monitoring-benchmark">the outcome-oriented predictive monitoring benchmark</a> and <a href="https://github.com/renuka98/interpretable_predictive_processmodel/tree/master/BPIC_Data">a previous work on interpreting this benchmark</a>. We thank the authors of the benchmark on outcome oriented predictions, for providing the source code which enabled further study on the interpretability of the models. In addition to this, <a href="https://github.com/nogueirs/JMLR2018">a module developed to measure stability of feature subsets is used</a>.
